## Creating a clean and responsive website for a professional portfolio.

-My motivation was to create code to allow a password to be generated based on user input specifying length, uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers.
-I built this project so that Icould learn how to create functions that would allow for clean code to create a unique password.
-The problem that I solved were several actually, the first of which was how to have a pool of options to pull from based on user preference. Next was how not to generate a password that multiplied the specified attribute by the length given. Finally, how to combine the randomized options into a single string and display it.
-I learned about randomizing, about conditional statements, about for loops, and about displaying generated variables on a website.
